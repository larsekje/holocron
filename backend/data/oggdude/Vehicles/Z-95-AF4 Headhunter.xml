      [H3]Z-95-AF4 Headhunter[h3]

Designed as part of a joint venture between Incom Corporation and Subpro Corporation during the early days of the Clone Wars, the tiny Z-95 was considered one of the most capable starfighters of its day. Small, lightly armored, and shielded, the Headhunter is a one-man, short-range fighter powered by an lncom 44-a5 multi-reactor. The aerodynamic fuselage combined with an incredible thrust-to-weight ratio makes the Z-95 quite fast and agile. Initially classified as an interceptor and armed with wing-mounted triple blaster cannons, the Headhunter quickly proved itself a competent space superiority fighter. It has gone through numerous redesigns, and today, most sport twin laser cannons and concussion missile launchers. 

[P]Despite their age, the Z-95 remains a popular starfighter. Considered outdated compared to modern fighters such as Koensayr's Y-wing and Incom's brand new X-wing (a fighter that shares more than a passing resemblance to the Headhunter), sales of the little fighter are still brisk in the Outer Rim territories.</Description>
