  <Description>[H3]SU-42RS Flashblind Aerial Reconnaissance Airspeeder[h3]

The SU-42RS Flashblind, a militarized version of Soro-
Suub’s SU-40 high-performance airspeeder, is built for
high-altitude penetration and aerial reconnaissance.
Using the plans for a basic, preorder SU-40 civilian airspeeder
as its base, SoroSuub engineers with Alliance
sympathies produce the SU-42RS in small numbers.
The vehicles are distributed to Rebel cells through various
black market channels. This highly illegal act of corporate
largesse provides the Rebellion with a fast and
reliable reconnaissance speeder packed with technologies
that it would otherwise not have access to.
[P]Like its civilian cousin, the SU-42RS is built around
SoroSuub’s powerful, high-performance IN-780 ion
turbofan engine. Whereas the IN-780s used in the
SU-40 are tuned for all-around performance, those in
the SU-42RS are tuned for straight-line speed and
maximum lifting thrust. This reduces the Flashblind’s
overall agility, but allows the airspeeder to climb to altitude
quickly and to outrun nearly any fighter or missile
sent to intercept it. The Flashblind retains the long, graceful, needlelike fuselage, short, razor-thin wings,
and two-position cockpit of its civilian cousin. It is
slightly larger, however, featuring a stiffened, lengthened
fuselage and light, anti-splinter armor around the
cockpit, the engine, and the sensor systems bay.</Description>
