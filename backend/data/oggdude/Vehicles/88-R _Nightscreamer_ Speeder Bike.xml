  <Description>[H3]88-R "Nightscreamer" Speeder Bike[h3]
An exceptionally high-performance speeder bike manufactured
by Ikas-Adno, the 88-R "Nightscreamer" is faster than some airspeeders. The Nightscreamer is equipped with forward deflector shields to protect the pilot from sand and debris particles-and even glancing collisions-that would be dangerous at the extreme maximum speeds it achieves. Though the Nightscreamer comes at a price that matches its impressive performance, many mercenaries and other fighters keep one in the hold of their ship for use as a rapid transport and scout vehicle. Some reckless warriors instead employ a Nightscreamer to swiftly close with enemies in order to deliver point-blank blaster shots or even melee weapon strikes.</Description>
