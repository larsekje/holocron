  <Description>[H3]Gungan Bongo Submarine[h3]
Bongos are the unique, handcrafted, submersible vehicles made by the Gungans of Naboo. Constructed around a rigid coral-like structure, each bongo is heavily armored against potential attack from the array of sea creatures found in the planet's oceans. The propulsion system of a bongo drives a long, twisting set of turbines, almost tentacle-like in appearance. which give the submarine an unusually high speed for an underwater craft. There appears to be no limit to the maximum depth attainable by a bongo, as they are able to withstand the crushing depths of the waterways that traverse the planetary core of Naboo.
[P]Bongos are incredibly versatile and are constructed for a wide array of functions, from passenger transport to cargo hauling and military troop deployment. The example provided here is a tribubble bongo, a personal passenger version.</Description>
