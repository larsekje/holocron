  <Description>[H3]Corellispace Gymsnor-4 Light Freighter[h3]

The Gymsnor-4 was CorelliSpace's fourth and final model in its light freighter series. A radical redesign from previous models, the Gymsnor-4 is a flying wing with a cockpit (which, like that of its predecessor, can separate and act as an escape pod) attached to the body by a narrow neck, giving the vessel an appearance resembling a mynock, something not lost on most spacers. Despite boasting several significant improvements over its predecessor, the Gymsnor-4 never managed to make a large impact on the light freighter market, spelling the end for CorelliSpace's aspirations to challenge CEC. While few Gymsnor-4 freighters can be found outside of Corellian space, the pilots and traders who operate them tend to view the ships fondly.

[H4]Modular Cockpit[h4]
As an action, the pilot may disconnect the cockpit, abandoning the rest of the vessel.  The craft's silhouette becomes 2 and its encumbrance capacity becomes 10.  Anything in the back of the ship (potentially including systems and attachments) is left behind.</Description>
