    [H3]YT-1210 Light Freighter[h3]

An older, reliable light freighter, the YT-1210 was a variant of another freighter in the YT series, the 1200. Since the release of the famous YT-1300, sales of the YT-1210 have slipped; doubly so because the ship competes with its close cousin, the YT-1200. 

[P]After the successful release of the YT-1200 (a reliable stock light freighter), Corellian Engineering Corporation designed a derivative design in an attempt to appeal directly to Corellians. Simply put, the YT-1210 is much like the YT-1200, only faster. A third main engine in the rear propels the ship to higher speeds, giving a freighter that can match some starfighters on a straight run. 

[P]Sadly, the freighter did not prove any more maneuverable, and the added engine reduced cargo space and armor-carrying capacity. The cost of manufacturing the YT-1210 also proved higher than anticipated. While the model still sells reasonably well, sales tend to be limited to Corellia and the surrounding sector.</Description>
