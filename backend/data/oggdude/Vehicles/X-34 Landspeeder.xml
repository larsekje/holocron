      [H3]X-34 Landspeeder[h3]

SoroSuub's X-34 is a two-passenger, coupe-styled civilian landspeeder known for its solid reputation for reliability. Powered by SoroSuub's Twinstar repulsorlift engine and supplemented by a trio of low-output turbofan engines, the X-34 provides utility and respectable performance, if not a large amount of style or dash, in a sturdy, affordable package. More utilitarian than many offerings from SoroSuub, this speeder has little in the way of amenities. It has a snug cockpit with two form-fitting seats covered in hard-wearing rubberized fabric. The controls are simple and the speeder is easy to drive, making it a useful utility speeder.</Description>
