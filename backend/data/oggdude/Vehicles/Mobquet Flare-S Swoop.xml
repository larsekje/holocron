      [H3]Mobquet Flare-S Swoop[h3]

Popular among swoop gangs and adrenaline junkies throughout the galaxy, the Fla re-S is the very epitome of the swoop builder's art. The Flare-S is a high-performance, one-person sport swoop built for raw, straight-line speed as opposed to agility. Powered by a supercharged Mobquet R1k repulsorlift engine supplemented by a number of thrust vectoring turbothrusters, this tiny swoop has enough power to overtake or outrun nearly anything in its class.</Description>
