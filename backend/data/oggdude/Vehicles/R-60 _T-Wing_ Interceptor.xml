  <Description>[H3]R-60 "T-Wing" Interceptor[h3]

The fast, lightweight R-60 T-wing is the latest starfighter offering from Hoersch-Kessel, Incorporated. Built to compete against the A-wing, the T-wing is a small, lightweight, short-range, fast response interceptor designed to operate close to its base of operation. With its sharp-edged, angular, wedge-shaped fuselage, the T-wing is an aggressive-looking little ship. Powered by a trio of H-K 5J Mk.11 afterburning ion engines, two mounted at the tips of the short s-foils and one mounted dorsally on a short pylon delivering thrust through an advanced vectoring system, on paper, the T-wing is a match for any Imperial fighter. In reality, however, the T-wing falls just short of the mark in a number of critical categories. 

[P]While the T-wing isn't actually dangerous to fly, it suffers from the use of cheap, poor quality components and is plagued with a variety of small but infuriating problems. The fighter's shields are too light for its intended role, and have a worrying tendency to fail under moderate enemy fire. While the T-wing is equipped with a hyperdrive, the T-60's navicomputer software is obsolete and full of coding errors that make navigation more an act of faith than anything else. 
[P]Despite these shortcomings, H-K hasn't slowed production and continues to search for a market for their bargain-basement interceptor. While the leadership of the Rebel Alliance refused to even consider the R-60 for service, a handful of third party operatives in the Outer Rim territories have shown interest in the T-wing, mostly due to its low cost and favorable parts and service packages offered by H-K salesmen.</Description>
