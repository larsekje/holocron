  <Description>[H3]Com C-52 Modular Command Center[h3]
The
C-52 is a smaller, more compact command
center module designed for small bases and
platoon-level command. It can hold between fifteen
and twenty people and features one large
open room good for a command and control
space, with plenty of room for workstations,
holotables, and assorted equipment. Its handful
of smaller rooms are useful as comms stations,
offices, and private meeting spaces.
