  <Description>[H3]HT-2200 Medium Freighter[h3]

Corellian Engineering Corporation's HT-2200 is a lumbering, slab-sided medium freighter initially designed to capitalize on the success of CEC's wildly popular YT-series of light freighters. Solidly built and packed with state of the art avionics and cargo handling systems, these massive vessels are shaped like a tuning fork with the crew, weapons, and engineering sections in the central hull and four airtight cargo holds in the port and starboard booms. The trademark CEC conical cockpit is located amidships between the booms, giving the pilot and co-pilot a nearly 180 degree view of their surroundings. The ship's primary selling point, aside from its vast cargo capacity for a ship of its size, is the design of its holds. Each of the four holds is shielded, reinforced, and contains a number of modular cargo systems that allow them to be configured for different types of cargo. In addition, each hold has its own environmental systems, allowing the crew to adjust the temperature, atmospheric makeup, and gravity of each hold separately. 

[P]Initial reviews were favorable, and orders steadily came in from large shipping concerns in the mid and Outer Rim territories. As pilots and crews became more familiar with them, however, they reported a number of serious shortcomings. While the hull and power distribution systems were designed to allow the types of modification and hot-rodding that CEC ships are famous for, the ships' primary power generator was woefully underpowered. In addition, thanks to these power shortcomings and the choice of Koensayr's single-tube ion drive as its primary drive, the HT-2200 proved slow and sluggish with poor acceleration and even poorer maneuverability. This, along with its surprisingly light weapons loadout, made the freighters easy pickings for pirates. Despite all of their inherent flaws, HT-2200s remain in limited production, thanks to their advanced cargo systems and sturdy hull.</Description>
