  <Description>[H4]Ishi Tib[h4]

Hailing from the planet of Tibrin in the Mid Rim, the
Ishi Tib are an amphibious species that evolved from
large, bony fish native to the reefs of their homeworld.
They are keenly aware of their world’s natural balance,
and have striven for millennia to ensure its ecology
is not unduly affected by their presence. They are
a pensive species and rarely act impulsively, making
them excellent planners and strategists. They are also
dedicated to the tasks they pursue, finding it difficult
to abandon an assignment once they set their minds
to accomplishing it.  A number of Ishi Tib have joined
the Rebel Alliance, where they are greatly valued as
tacticians and planners.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Ishi Tib are amphibious humanoids who
possess leathery green skin and two eyestalks that
extend from their heads at a somewhat jaunty angle.
Their eyes are typically yellow with slitted pupils,
though colors such as orange and yellow-green have
also been observed. Ishi Tib faces also feature two
pouch-like cheeks, which are used to store food such
as algae, microscopic organisms, and small crustaceans.
In the center of the face is a powerful beaklike
mouth. While Ishi Tib commonly use their beaks
to crack open crustacean exoskeletons or shellfish
shells, their mouthparts can also provide an improvised
weapon in dire circumstances.
[P]The bodies of Ishi Tib are bulky and muscular.
Their thick limbs end in two-fingered hands and finlike
feet that allow them to swim unimpeded through
the water. Though their thick skin is resistant to water
evaporation, the Ishi Tib are forever tied to the seas of
their homeworld. To prevent their bodies from drying
out, Ishi Tib must regularly immerse themselves in a
saline liquid similar to that of Tibrin’s oceans. Failure
to see to this basic need can result in disability and
death, often within a matter of days.
[P]Ishi Tib reproduce by laying eggs. Once fertilized, the
eggs are tended to in communal hatcheries dug into
sandbars near the coral reefs where the Ishi Tib build
their settlements. Reproduction is rarely done out of
personal desire. Eggs are fertilized only as their communities
require. After six years of maturation, Ishi Tib
children are developed enough to emerge from the
water. Due to the communal nature of child rearing,
Ishi Tib never know who their parents or children are.
[P][B]Society:[b] Ishi Tib society is based on communities
called "schools,” which can consist of up to 10,000
individuals. Each school is governed by a representative
who is elected to a one-year term of office. Representatives
rule based on ecological law—a series
of strictures that look to nature and the environment
.above all other things, for guidance. Ecological law
dictates that the needs of the environment take precedence
over the needs of groups or individuals.
[P]Due to this unique outlook, Ishi Tib are suspicious
of new technologies. Each new device, technology, or
scientific process introduced to their planet is rigorously
reviewed according to ecological law, with the
potential impact to the environment analyzed from
countless angles. Without approval, such advances are
immediately outlawed. Even those that are approved
are subject to intense regulation until such time as
their benefit is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
It is for this reason that many offworld corporations
avoid business with the Ishi Tib on their homeworld.
[P]Emigration from Tibrin is a rarity, and most Ishi Tib
are content to live out their lives on their homeworld.
Those Ishi Tib who do choose to leave their planet are
often tempted by job offers in the greater galaxy, for
members of their species are in great demand by other
governments and corporations. Due to their innate
ability to oversee complex projects, Ishi Tib are most
often desired as tacticians, executives, project managers,
planners, and accountants. Unfortunately, many
such Ishi Tib have been victimized by unscrupulous
corporations and then found themselves cut adrift in a
vast and unfamiliar galaxy.
[P]Ishi Tib do not marry, and mating is conducted only
in times of low population or some other pressing need.
This, of course, is not to say that they do not seek out
social interaction with others. Although they prefer relationships
with other Ishi Tib, in the absence of their own
kind, they focus these feelings on their associates.</Description>
