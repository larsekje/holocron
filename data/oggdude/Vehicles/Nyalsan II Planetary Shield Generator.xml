  <Name>Nyalsan II Planetary Shield Generator</Name>
  <Description>[H3]Nyalsan II Planetary Shield Generator[h3]
DefenStar Ltd. produces a number of planetary shield
generators designed to protect everything from small,
platoon-sized camps to huge forward garrisons that
house thousands of troops, personnel, and weapons.
The Nyalsan II is a medium-sized shield generator
used by both the Empire and the Alliance (when they
can get it) to protect roughly company-sized, vehiclereliant
units like tank units or planetary fighter squadrons.
Using DefenStar’s patented shutter shield
technology, the Nyalsan II uses a number of smaller,
high-output shield generators to produce a shifting,
adjustable network of overlapping energy fields. This
field network can be moved instantly around a position
to reinforce one area, or to open another to allow for
vehicle launch or counterattack by troops. The shield
system comes complete with generators, a prefabricated
control bunker, and all the necessary equipment
to set the system up and activate it. It requires a crew
of eighteen technicians and engineers to operate it.
[P]The Nyalsan II provides a ranged defense of 2 to
each quadrant (north, south, east, and west) of a base.
Ranged defense points can be reassigned to different
quadrants by the shield generator’s crew based
on need, in a manner similar to the Angle Deflector
Shields maneuver on page 246 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b]
Core Rulebook.
