  <Description>[H3]Protector Fang Fighter[h3]
Built for the Protectors' exclusive use, this agile starfighter is based on the designs for the Death Watch Gauntlet fighter used in the Clone Wars. The Fang fighter, however, is more compact and agile. Combining blazing speeds rarely found in other snubfighters with a unique pivot wing design to allow for unmatched maneuverability, the Fang Fighter is almost unrivaled when it comes to dogfighting. With dual laser cannons mounted on its rotating wingtips and a hidden proton torpedo launcher in its underbelly, the Fang fighter is capable of quickly destroying more heavily armored starfighters. Unfortunately, its lack of heavy armor, which allows it to maintain precision maneuverability, means that the Fang fighter can be destroyed with a few well aimed laser blasts.</Description>
