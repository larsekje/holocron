  <Description>[H3]Corellispace Gymsnor-3 Light Freighter[h3]

Produced by CorelliSpace, a well-funded private firm that sought to compete with the CEC juggernaut, the Gymsnor series of light freighters saw limited success. While never coming close to rivaling the YT-series in sales, the Gymsnor series did make a small dent in the market with the Gymsnor-3. Significantly different from CEC designs, the Gymsnor-3 is a long, segmented vessel with a cockpit section connected to a larger cargo hold and engine housing by a narrow neck. In the event of an emergency, the cockpit can detach from the rest of the vessel. Though adequate for shipping cargo, the Gymsnor-3 suffers from poor handling and a large defensive blind spot to the aft of the vessel. 

[H4]Modular Cockpit[h4]
As an action, the pilot may disconnect the cockpit, abandoning the rest of the vessel.  The craft's silhouette becomes 2 and its encumbrance capacity becomes 10.  Anything in the back of the ship (potentially including systems and attachments) is left behind.</Description>
