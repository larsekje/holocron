    [H3]85-XS Odyssey Heavy Speeder Bike[h3]

Aratech's Odyssey is a speeder bike built for adventure. Based on the reliable 74-Y speeder bike platform, this two-person speeder bike was designed for long-distance travel over rough terrain. Built with exploration in mind. the Odyssey features a reinforced frame, heavy-duty power systems, improved repulsorlift drives, and capacious storage for luggage and supplies. A compact and extremely powerful ground-following sensor suite mated to a navigation system makes handling the heavy vehicle easy for nearly any sentient. Not as common or popular as the 74-Y, the 85-XS enjoys slow-but-steady sales and can be found relatively easily on less-developed worlds where ruggedness and reliability take precedence over speed and handling.</Description>
