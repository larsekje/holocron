  <Description>[H3]Enormous Space Slug[h3]
[P]Space slugs, also known as exogorths, are one of the largest silicon-based life forms in the galaxy. Space slugs dwell in asteroid fields and radiation zones, living on a steady diet of rocks, stellar radiation, mynocks, and the occasional starship. These snakelike creatures are truly enormous. They hide in chewed-out burrows, waiting for unsuspecting prey to fly into their wide-open mouths before swallowing them whole.
[P]The enormous space slug is presented as a starship profile, but is an independent creature. When rolling for initiative or attacking with its insatiable maw, it rolls a Coordination skill check, counting as having Coordination 3 and Agility 1.</Description>
