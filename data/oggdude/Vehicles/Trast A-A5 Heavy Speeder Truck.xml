      [H3]Trast A-A5 Heavy Speeder Truck[h3]

Built by Trast Heavy Transports, the A-A5 is a popular vehicle among the Outer Rim Territories. Built to haul heavy bulk cargo long distances over rough terrain, the lumbering A-A5 has a stiff and rugged hull equipped with hardened systems that can shrug off even the heaviest abuse. In addition, armor add-ons can make it all but impervious to small-arms fire. The vehicle is separated into two main compartments: the crew compartment and the cargo compartment. The cargo compartment is capacious and features a number of tie-downs, latches, and other cargo management apparatuses that keep the cargo safe and secure. When not hauling cargo, fold-out benches in the cargo hold can be deployed to carry up to twenty-five sentients, albeit in cramped and uncomfortable conditions. </Description>
