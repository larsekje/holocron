  <Description>[H4]Chagrian[h4]

A balanced and serene species, Chagrians are peaceful
and stoic. They hail from a wealthy planet, and few
native Chagrians have wanted for life’s basic necessities—
or even many of its luxuries. As such, Chagrians
are rarely greedy or avaricious, and their desires are
seldom motivated by such basic needs. Additionally,
Chagrians are sticklers for procedure and law,
and they are unwilling to deviate from the legal and
bureaucratic systems they are accustomed to. Such
predilections ensure that Chagrians make excellent
Soldiers, Commanders, and Diplomats.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Chagrians begin their lives in an immature
tadpole form some thirty centimeters in length. Born in
clutches of two or three siblings, they are cared for by
their parents in sealed tubs kept within the home. As
they mature, Chagrian children develop arms, legs, and
lungs that allow them to breathe air. Once their limbs
are fully developed, young Chagrians leave the water,
and the last vestiges of their intermediate physiology
begin to fade away. Adult Chagrians are humanoid and
stand two meters tall on average. They possess powerful,
muscular bodies well suited to swimming and
heavy labor. As a result of their homeworld’s exposure
to an unstable sun during their species’ evolution, Chagrian
skin runs the gamut from light blue to cerulean to
indigo, and it provides them with an innate resistance
to harmful radiation. Though their planet’s sun has
been stable for millennia, this radiation resistance has
become a dominant trait of their species.
[P]Chagrians possess elegant horns growing down
from the sides of their heads. Males possess a second
set atop their skulls, called lethorns. Once used during
mating rituals, the horns were also employed as
weapons during formal duels. Though duels for mates
have since been outlawed, Chagrians, especially
males, consider their horns a sign of status. A large
portion of Chagrian daily personal ritual consists of
caring for their horns, filing and decorating them in an
otherwise uncharacteristic display of vanity.
[P]Despite having air-breathing lungs, Chagrians are as
comfortable below the waves of their planet as they
are above them. They are excellent swimmers, and
their eyes have developed to help them see in dim,
subaquatic light. Able to breathe underwater as well,
Chagrians can remain submerged for months or years
at a time without suffering any ill effects. They adapt
easily to the seas of other planets as long as the alien
ocean’s chemistry is similar to that of their own planet.
[P]Because of their constant exposure to the salty
oceans of their planet, Chagrians can taste little else
but salt. As a result, their sense of taste is incredibly
weak, and they obtain little pleasure from eating.
Rather than tasting food, Chagrian tongues act to
enhance their sense of smell, much as those of some
reptilian species. As such, they can often be seen
briefly flicking their tongues out when assessing the
viability of unfamiliar food or drink.
[P][B]Society:[b] Chagrian society is law abiding and peaceful.
Justice, both legal and social, is valued above all other
things, and Chagrian courts are some of the most fair
and balanced in the galaxy. Both criminal and civil
investigations are meticulous and thorough, and even
the most innocuous forms of evidence are carefully
studied. Even those Chagrians put on trial are all too
willing to admit their guilt, and only the most craven
Chagrians deny the charges brought against them if
they are true. This ensures that most criminal trials
are brief affairs with little, if any, fanfare.
[P]Given their homeworld’s focus on tourism, Chagrians
are accommodating and obedient—sometimes to
a fault. Despite this desire to please others, Chagrians
aren’t ignorant of cruelty or bias. In fact, their affluent
culture allows them to take notice of social injustices
more quickly than other, less privileged species, who
might otherwise consider such inequity to be normal.
[P]Because of the richness of their homeworld and
the amenities enjoyed by their people—such as
excellent medical care, higher education, and social
equality—Chagrians rarely want for anything. As a
result, they are easily disturbed by concepts such
as prejudice, homelessness, disease, and starvation,
especially when confronted with them on other
worlds. Many Chagrians are so moved by such sights
that they seek to remedy them, whether through
charity, by taking direct action, or by using local law
to initiate lasting change.
[P]The majority of the Chagrian economy centers on tourism.
Champala has always been a popular resort destination
for affluent travelers from the Core Worlds and
beyond. The planet's warm climate, pristine beaches,
and friendly denizens once attracted millions of visitors
every year. Unfortunately, the Chagrian choice to support
the Rebel Alliance, as well as the Empire’s subsequent
occupation of Champala, has caused the tourism
industry to dwindle exponentially.
[P]The Empire has expanded Champala’s mining
and manufacturing operations tenfold, resulting in
its once-pristine seas’ becoming poisoned by industrial
pollution. The Chagrian people shoulder the
burden of the Imperial occupation with their typical
stoicism, torn between their desire for freedom
and their unwillingness to see their society ground
beneath the boot of Imperial brutality.
[P][B]Language:[b] The native language of Chagrians is
called “Chagri,” a pleasant tongue that rarely sees
use outside of Champala. Though few Chagrians living
on Champala speak Basic, those who venture out
into the galaxy learn it with relative ease.
[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] Following Palpatine’s rise to power,
the Chagrian people deduced correctly that the Empire
was a cruel and pitiless regime. Many Chagrians have
since joined the Rebel Alliance, and they have proven
invaluable in the liberation of many water worlds—
including Mon Cala—from the Empire’s tyranny.
[P]Due to their penchant for adhering to the rule of
law, including military code, Chagrians make excellent
Commanders. They are also capable Diplomats, Soldiers,
and Spies, though their species’ lack of technological
know-how results in few Chagrian Engineers.</Description>
