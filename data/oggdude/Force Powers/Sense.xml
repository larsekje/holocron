    [H4]Force Power: Sense[h4]

By opening his mind, a Force user can commune with the world around him . He senses the endless movement of the Living Force, seeing beyond what his eyes allow. The actions of those around him are laid bare, as if the Force user had a bird's eye view of his surroundings, allowing him to anticipate attacks and better strike blows of his own, or even spot ambushes and lurking foes. Alternatively, he can sense the thoughts of others. Even a Jedi cannot read someone's mind completely, but a Force-sensitive being can detect his target's feelings and emotions, and even sense surface thoughts.

[P]Unlike many other Force powers, Sense has a basic power that can be used in two very different ways. Users can rely on Sense to augment their defensive (and eventually offensive) abilities, or they can invest in the ability to read the emotions and feelings of others. They can even read their surface thoughts, which can be particularly valuable in a wide variety of situations.</Description>
