    "description": "Using an updated and streamlined galven pattern and heavy-duty static pulse adaptors, this custom barrel increases both the damage output and armor penetration of blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles. The trade-off for all this extra stopping power is increased wear and tear on both the frame of the blaster and the barrel, leading to an increase in maintenance and down-time. This attachment can only be used with blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles.",
